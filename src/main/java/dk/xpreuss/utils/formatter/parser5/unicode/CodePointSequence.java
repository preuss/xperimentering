/**
 * A {@code CodePointSequence} is a readable sequence of {@code codePoint} values. This
 * interface provides uniform, read-only access to many different kinds of
 * {@code codePoint} sequences.
 * A {@code codePoint} value represents a character in the <i>Basic
 * Multilingual Plane (BMP)</i> or a surrogate. Refer to <a
 * href="Character.html#unicode">Unicode Character Representation</a> for details.
 *
 * <p> This interface does not refine the general contracts of the {@link
 * Object#equals(Object) equals} and {@link
 * Object#hashCode() hashCode} methods. The result of testing two objects
 * that implement {@code CodePointSequence} for equality is therefore, in general, undefined.
 * Each object may be implemented by a different class, and there
 * is no guarantee that each class will be capable of testing its instances
 * for equality with those of the other.  It is therefore inappropriate to use
 * arbitrary {@code CodePointSequence} instances as elements in a set or as keys in
 * a map. </p>
