FSM = Transducer = Finite automatat with output = Finite automata + Ouput Capability;
======================================================================================

Description of finite automata with output machine M is defined by 6-tuples are as follows;

M = (Q, Σ, δ, ∆, λ, q0)
Where, each tuple have its specification and meaning.

Q: It represents the finite non-empty set of states.
Σ: (Sigma) It presents the finite non-empty set of the input alphabet.
δ : (Delta) It represents the state transition function. The state transition function takes the current state from Q and an input alphabet from Σ and returns the new set of output alphabets and the next state. Therefore, it can be seen as a function which maps an ordered sequence of input alphabets into a corresponding sequence, or set, of output events.
Q × Σ  → Q is the next-state function.
∆: (Delta uppercase) It presents the output alphabet.
λ : (Lambda) It represent the output function. Its mathematically denotes as;
Q → ∆
q0: It is the initial state (which may be fixed or variable depends on machine behavior).

If the FSM is given input letter a when in state q, it enters state δ(q, a). While in state q it produces the output letter λ(q).


Characteristics of Finite automata:
-----------------------------------
Finite automata with output machine have the following characteristic;

1.	Finite automata with output machines do not have final state/states.
2.	Machine generates an output on every input. The value of the output is a function of current state and the current input.
3.	Finite automata with output machines are characterized by two behaviors;
		I.	State transaction function (δ)[ State transition function (δ) is also known as STF]
		II.	Output function (λ) [Output function is also known as machine function (MAF)]
			δ: Σ × Q → Q
			λ: Σ × Q → O	[For Mealy machine]
			λ: Q → O		[For Moore machine]


Type of finite automata with output:
-------------------------------------
There are two types of finite automata with output:

1.	Mealy machine: Output is associated with transition.
	λ: Σ × Q → O
	Set of output alphabet O can be different from the set of input alphabet Σ.

2.	Moore machine: Output is associated with state.
	λ: Q → O
